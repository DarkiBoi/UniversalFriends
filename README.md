# UniversalFriends
A library that aims at having friends that are the same for each client.

This repository tries to make it possible for all clients to use the same friends list. Because it is annoying to manually set them for each client.
In addition it makes it possible to give players a different level of friendship. Also enemies can be saved.

Criticism and discussion are welcome. :)
